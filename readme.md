# QUIZ-GAME
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarkyDev/Quiz-Game/master/Images/questions.png)

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
This project was to show how I could put together a quiz game with many dynamic elements that would change during each play of the game (score,time,usersname,questions) but also to show how we can utilize local storage in practical and logical means. This project heavily relies on local storage for the score value to be used by multiple JS files and also keeping our users scores saved. We also used methods to pull questions from a larger object array and showed how we could not only target them specifically and input them into a presentable format but also use JS to validate the users choices to what the local js file considers correct.

## SOME OF THE ISSUES 
I really struggled with local storage with this project but genuinely feel I have a decent grasp of it now and realise how important and incredibly useful it can be,especially in terms of sharing js variables
